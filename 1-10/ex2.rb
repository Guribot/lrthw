# Comment
#you dont need a space
# But it looks better if you have one

puts "Hello I'm words you can read" # but these are comments you can't read

# I mean I can read them but the person running the program won't

puts "Here I am again"

# suckers

test = "These are words" # I can even put comments here?

puts test # And here

test2 = "I'm some words" # and I'm a comment "and even with quotes I will be a comment"

puts test, test2 # that color inconsistency is annoying

# I am not in the habit of putting a space between the # and my comment
# I would like to get better about that
# Note up there where I put a second # and it didn't end the comment or w/e
